# Motion-Detection-using-OpenCV
This project implements a real-time motion detection system using OpenCV in Python. It captures video frames from a webcam, compares consecutive frames to detect changes indicating motion, and highlights the moving areas with bounding boxes. Detected frames are then saved to an output video file.
